PulseAudio Sound Server
_______________________
On Linux systems the C++ SDK needs access to the PulseAudio Sound Server in order to successfully initialize. Therefore prior to running the
:ref:`Sample Application <getting_started_server>` make sure that the server has either system wide PulseAudio running or that an instance of PulseAudio is started by 
the same user who will run the sample application. Allowing the library access to the sound server.

To check if you have pulseaudio installed you can run:

.. code-block:: console

        $ pulseaudio --version


The Ubuntu server should already have pulseaudio installed, but if it accidentally does not run the following command. Note to use package manager you need to be super
user.

.. code-block:: console

        $ sudo apt-get install pulseaudio


When it is installed, starting pulseaudio for your user is done as follows:

.. code-block:: console

        $ pulseaudio
