Overview
""""""""
The Dolby.io Communications C++ SDK provides applications the ability to create high-quality voice and video for fully immersive real-time communications experiences. The C++ SDK allows creating an application that can join Dolby.io conferences.

The C++ SDK is responsible for communicating with the Dolby.io backend and providing conferencing functionalities, such as opening and closing sessions, joining and leaving conferences, sending and receiving messages, as well as receiving and injecting WebRTC media streams.

Currently, an instance of the C++ SDK can connect to only one conference at a time. Joining multiple conferences at a time requires running multiple instances of the application.

Core SDK
========
The Core C++ SDK handles all of the signalling with the Dolby.io backend as well as providing various events, messages and other valuable information to users. The Dolby.io Communications C++ SDK allows joining 
Dolby Voice Conferences where participants can send and receive high-quality voice streams, including spatial audio and shared scenes. This functionality is useful for integrating the Dolby Voice experience 
into your own game engine or virtual world experience. The C++ SDK provides applications the ability to capture and playback audio and video, manage input and output audio devices and input video devices, add 
spatial placement for participants, as well as partake in a shared spatial scene. 

The Audio captured using the Core C++ SDK features is processed using Dolby Voice audio processing and transmitted using the DVC-2 codec. This allows for clear, crisp conversations without echo or background noise and provides the option to use Dolby's world class 3D audio spatialization.

The C++ SDK offers full control of the video capture pipeline to applications. Applications have the ability to provide camera frames, inject their own frames from a file for instance, or attach a Video Processorplugin to provide filtered camera frames to the conference. The SDK also allows applications to connect their own sinks to incoming Video streams and receive the decoded video frames.

Media IO
===================
In addition to the Core features, the Dolby.io Communications C++ SDK also provides Media IO features. These include injecting audio from custom sources into conferences, connecting audio sinks to 
receive decoded PCM audio data and receiving encoded video frames before they are decoded. These features allow applications to connect as a client to a Dolby.io conference and record all of the present 
participants' video and audio. Think of it as recording a conference on your own machine without needing to pay for recording minutes. Additionally you can inject some media from an external source (a file for instance) into the conference (especially applicable for Virtual Worlds for example). Note that using the Media IO features for Audio currently forces the use of the Opus Codec.

To record conferences, the C++ SDK exposes incoming Audio and Video frames via the :cpp:class:`Audio Sink <dolbyio::comms::audio_sink>` and :cpp:class:`Video Sink <dolbyio::comms::video_sink>`/:cpp:class:`Encoded Video Sink <dolbyio::comms::video_sink_encoded>` interfaces. Applications can implement these interfaces themselves and use respective services to provide the recorders/injectors to the SDK.

Plugins
=======
The C++ SDK also allows applications to make use of our ready-to-use :ref:`plugins_api`. The C++ SDK provides a default media recorder plugin; a ready-to-use library that can be easily configured and included in an application. The plugin automatically records the incoming media streams for conference participants and stores the recorded streams in either raw or encoded format.  

The C++ SDK provides two default media injection plugins that are able to receive raw media frames and pass them to WebRTC. One of the default plugins is the Pacing Injector. The injector exposes an interface 
for an application and allows passing decoded audio and video. Then, the injector provides these frames to WebRTC at specified intervals.

The other default plugin is the Passthrough-Injector, which simply exposes the interface for passing decoded audio/video.
