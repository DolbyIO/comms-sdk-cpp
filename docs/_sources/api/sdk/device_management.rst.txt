Device Management Service
==========================

.. note::
  The Device Management Service is intended for Client Applications.

Once the SDK is instantiated, applications have access to the device management service. Currently, this allows managing audio input and output devices. This service provides the ability to:

 - Get the available audio devices
 - Set the preferred input and output devices
 - Check the currently set input and output device
 - Receive events about audio devices that have been added, removed, or changed
