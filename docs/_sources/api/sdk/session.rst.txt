Session Service
===============
The Session Service provides the ability to log in and out of the Dolby.io backend. Logging in to the backend is necessary to use any of the conferencing features
provided by the SDK.

The basic usage of the session service is:
  1) Log in to the session using the :cpp:func:`session::open <dolbyio::comms::services::session::open>` command.
  2) Listen to a conference and record it. For more information, see the :ref:`api_conference`.
  3) Log out of the session using the :cpp:func:`session::close <dolbyio::comms::services::session::close>` method.

Session Interface
-----------------
#include <comms/session.h>

The methods of the Session Interface provide the ability to connect to the Dolby.io
backend. The session service methods are all asynchronous in nature. For more information, refer to :ref:`api_async_result`. The structures defined in the interface
are used by and returned by methods of the interface.
